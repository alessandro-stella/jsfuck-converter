For reference documentation, visit this repository: https://github.com/aemkei/jsfuck.
I learned the basics from here, and it is an excellent guide for those who want to try their hand at learning JSFuck.

Browsing the web I came across an esoteric language I had never heard of, JSFuck.
Taking up the idea of ​​Brainfuck, one of the most popular esoteric languages, it uses only six of the characters normally used to program in Javascript.
Having already had experience with Brainfuck, the idea of ​​such a language intrigued me, and I was not disappointed.
I also decided to create a simple converter, whose link is at the beginning of this document. it's still a bit rough, but I hope you like it!
